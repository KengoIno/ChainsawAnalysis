# ChainsawAnalysis

## 1. Experimental Chainsaw Analysis
At first, to explore the possibility of chainsaw analysis by sensor data, I tried to analysis of experimental moving without engine vibration.  
I put smartphone with sensor logging app（[加速度・ジャイロ・磁界 マルチセンサーロガー](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F%E5%BA%A6-%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AD-%E7%A3%81%E7%95%8C-%E3%83%9E%E3%83%AB%E3%83%81%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%82%AC%E3%83%BC/id1505203547)） on the chainsaw and made move of tree felling, lumbering(chopping, pruning), and so on.  
Also, to verify the experiment, I recorded myself and connected raw sensor data and my move.  

This repositry includes, 

- Raw data of sensor logging app
- Code of analysis
- Discussion about experimental result
